                <p>After Meditation and then Reiki with you and going to get the crystals I came home cleaned up the backyard. Not sure why I did it then as I have been meaning to get to it for a week. Even cleaned off spider webs from al the exterior windows I could get to. Went out last night to a really nice bar (we must go!) to farewell two mothers from school. After a lovely night I came home at what I thought was 10:15 not exactly tired for the first time ever. It was actually 1.50 am, and I woke up before 8 not exhausted as I usually am. Turns out 2 of the 3 people I had dinner with LOVE the Hierophant, and the husband of one of them swears by reiki. They think you have a calling which must be fulfilled.</p>

                <p>Normally I feel very sore and tired after I do some exercise, I don't feel this anymore. I feel so much energy im like on adrenaline IV pump. Its still there when I went to bed. Tai Chi, Qigong and Yoga produces more energy now than other exercises but also I feel inner peace a sense of balance and harmony, deep intuition. Thank you so much Natalie.</p>

                <p>I have been very sick and unable to get out of bed, the doctors did not have the answers to what was going on with me, I started daily Healing Qigong on my walker and had to sit often. After 3 months of practising I have finally cut back on all my tablets and are off all pain relief.  I am feeling well and are really starting to feel into my feet again. I am walking unaided and can not thank you enough for teaching me this.</p>

                <p>When I met Natalie I was very stressed, had swelling in legs and feet, lower back injury, blisters on feet and little wounds, stressed and nervous, negative at times and needy not self confident, I had medical conditions; lymphatic drainage issues, insulin dependent diabetic (5 times daily); fluid retention, smokers cough, history of being sexually abused (5-15 years) and now i had become over sexed. I had a history of depression, I had a mental breakdown I couldnt even go outside at 39 years of age. I stayed with Natalie for 2-3 weeks having treatments every 2nd to 3rd day. Would have loved them everyday but Natalie was busy and I was Nursing.</p>
