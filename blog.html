                <p>Upon reflection I have learnt how vitally important it is to practice meditation and reflection on a daily bais to discover the various chasms assoiciated with its practice and obserrvation. I have discovered ow this practice has empowered me and enriched my life no end. Ifell such clarity now. I have gained and adopted a new spiritual family and they have positively enriched my life beyond words, we had so much fun! My training has absolutely confirmed that this is my calling, my passion, my gift. I am ready to impart my spiritual wisdom upon others and to help them enrich their spirtiual lives also finding clarity and focus.</p>

                <p>Firstly I just want to say this has been an amazing personal jouney for me that has changed my life and allowed me to see life with fresh eyes. I got to meet and work with some amazing people and Natalie you are a true breathe of fresh air, a true Goddess and Healer and a friend for life. I have learnt so much and have been given amazing tools that I can not only use for my own development but tools and knowledge than I can passon to ppotential clients, friends and family members. I had never mediated before, done any form of yoga or been able to manage stress in my life without falling to pieces. Meditation is now part of my everyday life and I make sure I have time fo it everyday.</p>

                <p>"At the heart of their model is practicing a new way of seeing the world and taking more effective actions in the face of our ickiness. We talk about it in our Note on Jonathan Haidt’s *genius* The Happiness Hypothesis where he says: “Depressed people are caught in a feedback loop in which distorted thoughts cause negative feelings, which then distort thinking further. Beck’s discovery is that you can break the cycle by changing the thoughts. A big part of cognitive therapy is training clients to catch their thoughts, write them down, name the distortions, and then find alternative and more accurate ways of thinking. Over many weeks, the client’s anxiety or depression abates.”</p>

                <p>Gentleness is the strength behind true power, and it comes from feeding yourself with nourishing words, thoughts, deeds, intentions, and all forms of food.  Shield yourself from harshness by placing an intention to attract only kind and gentle life lessons and relationships. Tranform harshness into gentleness by refusing to see anything but the shining light that is within each person and situation. This intention begins with your relationship with yourself. Be very gentle with ourself in all ways. Be happy, be kind, be sweet, but most of all, be ture to you".</p>
