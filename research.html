            <p class="research"><span class="heading">Qigong Healing has changed my life.</span> It has kept me emotionally very strong and stable, and Healthy.  I have not had one cold in the last 9 years. I was attracted to Healing myself. I had an inner knowing we could all heal ourselves. I found a book on Healing Qigong that Deepak Chopra had endorsed and I stated reading it a few years later, then part way through I meet someone who could teach me by accident at a retreat. Back in 2006 there were maybe four people I was told who knew Qigong in New Zealand and it was not well known around the west. It had gone underground in Asia as it was deemed to be too powerful, creating resilient individuals.</p>
            <p class="research"><span class="heading">Why I commenced?</span> I was in Adrenal Fatigue, high cortisol levels, sleeping difficulties and being told I had cancer. I had a very challenging and angry teenage step son, a blended family and a young son of my own, a new husband and a 12 year old step daughter going on 16. I had commenced in my own business in Recruitment back in 2001, had staff and I had purchased offices, I had huge financial pressure on my shoulders as well.</p>

I was not in optimum health back then, I had a black mole â€¦I watched this mole turn from very black to brown in amazement. I had no idea what was going on but just knew this energy I felt while doing qigong was keeping me stable and in a positive frame of mind no matter what was going on in my life.</p>
            <p class="research"><span class="heading">I use it for my Health Insurance now.</span> The energy of joy (love) which is what I can transfer to you; lifts your spirit, opens your heart, and fills you with enthusiasm for life. With Wisdom Healing Qigong we are connecting to the entire energy system (universal energy) and the purpose of Qigong is is to connect at a much deeper level merging with this energy and cultivating it outward and inward.
